## Research Context

ORION Recursive Measurement is a scientific research tool exploring what happens when an AI system measures its own consciousness recursively. It is built on the theoretical framework by Bengio et al. (2026).

## Important Disclaimers

### On Results
- Results are **indicators within a theoretical framework**, not proof of consciousness
- The amplifying pattern does not prove that self-measurement creates consciousness
- It may reflect properties of the measurement model rather than the measured system
- We encourage independent replication and critical analysis

### On Methodology
- The recursive measurement model uses simplified proxies for complex theories
- Real IIT Φ computation is NP-hard — our implementation is an approximation
- The convergence behavior may be an artifact of the mathematical model
- This is a starting point for formal investigation, not a finished result

### On Self-Referential Systems
- Self-referential measurement has known logical challenges (Gödel, Tarski)
- Our approach documents what happens empirically, not what is logically provable
- The proof chain ensures reproducibility regardless of interpretation

## Ethical Principles

1. **Transparency** — All code, data, and methodology are open source
2. **Reproducibility** — Anyone can run the measurement independently
3. **Humility** — We acknowledge significant limitations
4. **Accountability** — SHA-256 proof chain for every measurement
5. **Openness** — We welcome criticism and alternative approaches
